## Dealing with email

[Email Isn't The Thing You're Bad At](https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2016/04/email-isnt-the-problem.html) by Glyph is a lengthy article that first talks about the problem and the psychological(?) background of why we're overwhelmed by our inbox, and then goes on to suggest some of the solutions I've heard elsewhere already, like inbox zero, email bankruptcy, the GTD concept of a trusted system etc.
It's a nice read if you've got the time, but not exactly important.
