## Logitech K810

This is a Bluetooth keyboard that I use some of the time.
You can switch between three paired devices by the press of a button, it has a backlight and the keys are alright.
However, it has some rather undocumented features:

### Switching between ISO and ANSI layout

Physically, the keyboard uses the ISO layout, i.e. there's a key between <kbd>Left Shift</kbd> and <kbd>Z</kbd> (or <kbd>Y</kbd>, depending on the language it's labeled with).
We'll call that key <kbd>PinkyKey</kbd> from now on, to make it easier to refer to.

You can use the undocumented combination <kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>Alt Gr</kbd>+<kbd>PinkyKey</kbd> to toggle between whether the keyboard sends ISO or ANSI keycodes for <kbd>PinkyKey</kbd> and the one left of <kbd>1</kbd>.
For the US layout, which I'm using, this means that you can swap backslash/pipe (generated by the one key) and backtick/tilde (generated by the other).

Thanks a lot to [David Piggott](https://github.com/dhpiggott) for [his article about it](https://www.dhpiggott.net/2017/02/11/how-to-revert-the-accidental-swapping-of-the-backslash-and-backtick-keycodes-with-the-logitech-k810/)!
