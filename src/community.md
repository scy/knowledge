In [a Twitter thread about the Go team's abandoning of the `dep` dependency manager](https://twitter.com/_rsc/status/1022588240501661696), Russ Cox writes:

Worse, the course correction surprised a lot of people, because we'd only shared concerns with the package management group. [[1]](https://twitter.com/_rsc/status/1022592025919737856)
> I thought I could focus on the technical details and let the pkg mgmt group run community interactions. Somehow that led to the entire community believing that Dep was the official endgame, even though my discussions with the pkg mgmt group were clear it was not on that track.

But those concerns were basically ignored, with the result that Dep is and remains unfit as a design for go command integration. [[4]](https://twitter.com/_rsc/status/1022592179175342080)

> Making the discussions public instead probably would have been better for adjusting everyone's expectations, and maybe it would have resulted in Dep's design focusing on the showstoppers for go command integration and being easier to incorporate.
